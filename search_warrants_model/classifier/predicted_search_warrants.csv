By motion dated  June 8, 2020 (EFC No. 54), Defendant Anthony Molina (""Molina"") sought, inter  alia, to suppress all the evidence, including his cellphone and its contents,  se ized by the Government in connection with his arrest. By Opinion and Order,  dated September 24, 2020, the Court set this matter for an evidentiary hearing  to resolve the validity of the seizure of Molina's cellphone.  (ECF No. 87.) On October  2, 2020, the Government, represented by Assistant U.S.  Attorney Lindsey Keenan, informed the Court that it did not intend to offer the  cellphone, nor its contents, in its case-in-chief at trial. See Government's  letter, dated October 2, 2020.  As a result, the Government asserted that the  need for a hearing was mooted. Defendant Molina's counsel, Jason Ser, asserts  that a hearing is still necessary because there is a reference to Molina's  cellphone in one of the affidavits su bmitted in support of the Government's  application for a search warrant: However, since Defendant Molina's motion,  which specifically sought to suppress the cell and its contents, is now  essentially granted, there is no longer a need for a hearing. Accordingly, the  hearing scheduled for October 20, 2020 is  cancelled as moot. The Clerk of Court  is requested to terminate the motion (ECF No. 90).  SO ORDERED.

Defendant Abraham Hernandez (""Hernandez"") is charged with one count of possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 2252A(a)(5)(B) and  (b)(2). Hernandez now moves, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment and Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for an order suppressing certain evidence (the ""Motion,"" Dkt. No. 14). Specifically, Hernandez challenges: (1) police offi cers' initial warrantless entry into his apartment on November 7, 2018, the ensuing search and securing of his apartment, and all evidence that is the fruit of those actions; (2) the warrantless search of Hernandez's Kik account information , and (3) a later federal search warrant (the ""Warrant"") and all evidence stemming from the Warrant. (See ""Memorandum,"" Dkt. No. 15.) After receiving the Government's memorandum in opposition to the Motion on June 10, 2019 (& quot;Opposition,"" Dkt. No. 17), the Court held oral argument on the Motion on September 6, 2019. At the Court's instruction, oral argument focused on Hernandez's challenges to the New York City Police Department's (""NYPD' ;s"") initial entry into his apartment, the ensuing search, evidence that is the fruit of that entry and search, and the later Warrant. Based on the motion papers and oral argument, the Court concluded that the Motion turned on disputed issues of  fact - in particular: whether Hernandez's mother voluntarily consented to the police officers' initial entry and search of the apartment; whether exigent circumstances justified the officers' initial entry and search of the apartment;  whether the affidavit submitted to the magistrate judge by federal agents in support of the search warrant application contained material deliberately or recklessly false statements or omissions; and whether probable cause existed for Hernandez' ;s arrest. Accordingly, the Court held an evidentiary hearing to address these issues. For the reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES the Motion....[See this Decision And Order]... IV. ORDER: For the above reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that the motion to suppress (Dkt. No. 14) of defendant Abraham Hernandez is DENIED. SO ORDERED.

The current indictment is based on the results of a search, pursuant to a warrant, conducted after a probation officer observed evidence of possible drug dealing during a routine home visit. Following the execution of the search warran t, Falu was charged with possession with intent to distribute mixtures containing cocaine base and methamphetamine and with being a felon  in possession of ammunition (fifteen bullets having been found in his room). Falu, who is now 32, first came to  the attention of the criminal justice system at age 17. According to the Pretrial Services report, he has four adult convictions including an earlier federal conviction for distribution of oxycodone for which he received a four-year sentence, and mo st recently he pled guilty to  a charge of escape from a re-entry center which followed his  incarceration on the oxycodone conviction. He also has been charged with   violating his conditions of supervised release as a consequence of the home visit  described above. In addition, the Court counts the issuance of six bench warrants in the pretrial report.   Given this defendant's history of repeated criminal conduct, defiance of court orders, and disregard for the conditions of release, he ca nnot meet the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that he will neither flee nor pose a danger to  any other person or the community. Fed. R. Cr. P. 32.1 (a)(6). Nor has the defendant made a showing that he is entitled to temporary  release given the absence of any medical condition specific to this defendant. This application has been resolved on the basis of the lengthy written submissions given the Court's familiarity with this  defendant (having previously denied a bail application) and given the extremely limited access to in-court proceedings.

The United States courthouses in Manhattan, White Plains, and Poughkeepsie will remain open for business, subject to the following limitations: 2. Effective March 16, 2020, all civil and criminal jury trials in the Southern District of New York scheduled to begin before April 27, 2020, are continued pending further order of the Court. The Court may issue other orders concerning future continuances as necessary and appropriate. 3. Compliance with all trial-specific deadlines in civil and criminal cases scheduled to begin before April 27, 2020, are continued pending further order of the Court. 4. Individual judges presiding over civil and criminal proceedings may take such actions consistent with this order as may be lawful and appropriate to ensure the fairness of the proceedings and preserve the rights of the parties.5. Nothing in this order is meant to affect jury trials that began prior to March 16, 2020, and have not yet concluded. 6. Existing grand juries will continue in operation. 7. The Court is cognizant of the right of criminal defendants to a speedy and public trial under the Sixth Amendment, and the particular application of that right in cases involving defendants who are detained pending trial. Any motion by a criminal defendant seeking an exception to this order in order to exercise that right should be directed to the District Judge assigned to the matter in the first instance; provided, however, that no such exception may be ordered without the approval of the Chief Judge after consultation with the assigned judge. 8. The time period of any continuance entered as a result of this order shall be excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7) (A), as the Court finds that the ends of justice served by taking that action outweigh the interests of the parties and the public in a speedy trial. Absent further order of the Court or any individual judge, the period of exclusion shall be from March 16, 2020, to April 27, 2020. The Court may extend the period of exclusion as circumstances may warrant. 9. Individual judges may continue to hold hearings, conferences, and bench trials in the exercise of their discretion, consistent with this order. 10. Judges are strongly encouraged to conduct court proceedings by telephone or video conferencing where practicable. 11. Criminal matters before Magistrate Judges, such as initial appearances, arraignments, detention hearings, and the issuance of search warrants, shall continue to take place in the ordinary course. 12. The Clerks Office, the District Executives Office, Pre-Trial Services, Probation, the Bankruptcy Court, and all other Court services shall remain open pending further order of the Court. SO ORDERED.

Plaintiff Natalie Smith has brought a motion to compel non-party Luxury   Leather Brands, LLC (""LLB"") to produce documents in response to a  subpoena,   and to impose appropriate sanctions on its failure to produce documents. Dkt.   No. 140. Plaintiff previously brought a motion to compel on February 6, 2020,   which this Court denied as moot based on LLB's representation that it wou ld   produce the requested documents. Dkt. No. 139. The below facts are taken from    the letters submitted by the parties; as further set forth herein.            Plaintiff has shown good cause for the issuance of an order compelling  discovery agai nst  LLB. The parties have agreed upon search terms and LLB needs to produce.   Although LLB  explains that compliance with the subpoena is not a small undertaking, it is   undisputed that the  subpoena was properly served on September 18, 2019 and t hat LLB has had over   five months to  complete this production. Nor has LLB properly substantiated any burden from  compliance  other than the time needed to review documents for privilege and relevance.   Dkt. No. 141. LLB  has had several months t o start and complete this review.   At the same time, some fault lies with Plaintiff in failing to raise the issue  with the Court  between the production deadline in October 2019 and the joint status letter   raising this issue in   January 2020. Se e Dkt. No. 133. Although the Court appreciates Plaintiff's  attempts to first   resolve the issue with LLB, in such a situation where non-compliance threatens  to prolong the  litigation and extend the Court-imposed deadlines, judicial intervention may   be warranted.  The motion to compel is GRANTED. The motion to impose sanctions is DENIED.  Non-party LLB is ordered to comply with the subpoena by March 13, 2020.     (Signed by Judge Lewis J.

Mark Dubowitz's Expert Testimony. In its response to Sadr's renewed objections to Mr. Dubowitz's testimony, the Government represents that it will not ""elicit any substantive testimony from Mr. Dubowitz regarding the history of sanctions against Iran, the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (""IRGC""), the U-Turn Exemption, or the entities that OFAC has designated as SDNs."" Dkt. No. 230 at 1. Rather, Mr. Dubowitz's testimony will be limited ""to explaining certain means, methods, and strategies of sanctions evasion as they relate to the charges in this case."" Id. The Court concludes that Mr. Dubowitz may testify to ""the process by which individuals establish or incorporate companies in foreign jurisdictions, the documents and disclosures needed to establish such companies, the concept and use of front and shell companies, the extent to which bank accounts may be established remotely,... the way international financial transactions may be conducted online and through email[,]... the process by which individuals obtain citizenship and passports in countries other than their country of birth, the process by which individuals obtain residency in foreign jurisdictions,... citizenship-by-investment programs[,]... bank secrecy laws in countries like Switzerland, [and] the manner in which money can be transferred electronically across various jurisdictions."" Id. at 2. He may explain these sophisticated concepts because they are beyond the ken of the average juror. However, to the extent the Government seeks to have Mr. Dubowitz ""explain how these complicated methods and means can be used together in order to obscure an individual or entity's connection to Iran,"" id., it may cross the line into testimony that runs afoul of Castillo v. United States, which prohibits expert testimony that invites the jury to infer the defendant's guilt ""from the behavior of unrelated persons,"" United States v. Castillo, 924 F.2d 1227, 1234 (2d Cir. 1991 ). In this regard, the Court will entertain objections to specific questions from Sadr during the course of the trial that he thinks crosses this line. If the Government has questions as to what it may say during opening statements in this regard, it may submit a specific proffer to the Court by Friday, February 28, 2020 at 12 p.m. In addition, to the extent the Government anticipates testimony that it believes will be permissible, but close to this line, it shall prepare a proposed limiting instruction, which it shall submit to the Court by Friday, February 28, 2020 at 12 p.m. 2. Government's Trial Exhibits Sadr's objections to the ""clean versions"" of the Government's trial exhibits fall into two categories. See Dkt. No. 222. First, he objects to documents that had cut off pages in the May 2018 production but have been replaced with clean, complete versions in the Government's trial exhibits. Second, he objects to documents that contain charts or text images that were illegible in the May 2018 production but have been replaced with completely legible versions in the Government's trial exhibits. With respect to both categories of documents, Sadr objects that they contain ""additional content that was not present in the previously-seized versions."" Id. at 2. The Court disagrees. The Court has already determined that all of the pages Sadr complains about were identified as responsive and seized during the course of a constitutional responsiveness review. See Dkt. No. 197. That technical issues may have resulted in these documents being cut off or rendered illegible in the May 2018 production does not mean that the reviewers seized cut off or illegible versions of these documents. Moreover, Sadr will not be prejudiced in any way by the Government using these 16 exhibits, because he has had access to the native files from which the Government pulled them since at least November 15, 2018, when the Government produced the original search warrant returns as Relativity load files to Sadr. See Dkt. No. 201 at 4-5. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Government may use the 16 exhibits to which Sadr objects at trial. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

    "### Phase 1 (preparation; Jeremy, 40 hrs; Justin, 8 hrs; between 3/1 and 4/1): \n",
    " - Compile a close-to-live database of relevant free Federal court filings data, pulling directly from PACER RSS feeds and the CourtListener's APIs.\n",
    " - Compile training data in consultation with the courts reporter for several of his heuristics. \n",
    " - Other preliminary infrastructure work, e.g. scraping DoJ press releases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2 (Jeremy, 120hrs; Justin 12 hrs; between 4/1 and 6/1):\n",
    " - Build custom models (classifiers and named-entity recognizers) to instrumentalize hand-written heuristics used by the courts reporter using docket data.\n",
    " - Test those models accuracy on held-out sets and also new data, plus human evaluation/research by Justin. (Revising as necessary.)\n",
    " - Alert documents considered accurate by the model to the courts reporter via Slack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3 (Jeremy, 60 hours; between 6/1 and 7/1):\n",
    " - For heuristics that aren't performing as well as we'd like, purchase dockets (10cents to a few dollars each) to provide the model with more information. This is a higher stakes test for the model, since it will involve automatically spending money.\n",
    " - Fetch and store those dockets (likely in the Free Law Project's RECAP database).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4 (\"stretch goals\"; if time permits):\n",
    "- Devise an AI-based method, based on consultation with a courts reporter, for guessing which documents we should purchase from a case. This is a greater challenge because we're asking the model to encode newsworthiness directly, rather than a more well-defined category.\n",

      "Order Granting (RE: related document(s)56 Motion for Sanctions Against the Debtor under Rule 9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure filed by Creditor Nicole Glodowski). This matter is before the court on a motion to impose sanctions against debtor Richard Glodowski filed by Nicole Glodowski, which debtor resisted. (Doc. #56; Doc. #65). Trial was held on February 24, 2021. Richard Register appeared for debtor. Thomas Helget appeared for Mrs. Glodowski. The court received evidence as detailed in Doc. #100.As the prevailing party, Mrs. Glodowski is entitled to recover the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred to present the motion. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(c)(1)(A). The $17,706.50 in invoiced fees includes fees to present the motion for sanctions. However, the invoices do not include time to present testimony at the hearing on the motion for sanctions, which lasted just over two hours. Therefore, Mrs. Glodowski is awarded an additional $450.00 for the time associated with the hearing. She is also awarded $444.00 in expenses, $428.40 of which was to transcribe debtor's 341 testimony. The testimony was offered at the hearing and relied upon in this opinion.All the fees incurred and awarded are warranted for effective deterrence by others similarly situated and are reasonable. Mr. Peterson's hourly rate is commensurate with his level of experience. His work is sufficiently described and itemized. The individual time entries were a necessary part of his representation of Mrs. Glodowski.Mrs. Glodowski's motion for sanctions is GRANTED. She is awarded attorney's fees of $12,592.00 plus expenses of $444.40. Separate judgment will be entered. ORDERED by Judge Brian S. Kruse. (See pdf Written Opinion in its entirety) Search terms: Fed.

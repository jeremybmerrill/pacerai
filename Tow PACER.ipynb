    "### Phase 1 (preparation; Jeremy, 40 hrs; Justin, 8 hrs; between 3/1 and 4/1): \n",
    " - Compile a close-to-live database of relevant free Federal court filings data, pulling directly from PACER RSS feeds and the CourtListener's APIs.\n",
    " - Compile training data in consultation with the courts reporter for several of his heuristics. \n",
    " - Other preliminary infrastructure work, e.g. scraping DoJ press releases\n",
    "### Phase 2 (Jeremy, 120hrs; Justin 12 hrs; between 4/1 and 6/1):\n",
    " - Build custom models (classifiers and named-entity recognizers) to instrumentalize hand-written heuristics used by the courts reporter using docket data.\n",
    " - Test those models accuracy on held-out sets and also new data, plus human evaluation/research by Justin. (Revising as necessary.)\n",
    " - Alert documents considered accurate by the model to the courts reporter via Slack.\n",
    "### Phase 3 (Jeremy, 60 hours; between 6/1 and 7/1):\n",
    " - For heuristics that aren't performing as well as we'd like, purchase dockets (10cents to a few dollars each) to provide the model with more information. This is a higher stakes test for the model, since it will involve automatically spending money.\n",
    " - Fetch and store those dockets (likely in the Free Law Project's RECAP database).\n",
    "### Phase 4 (\"stretch goals\"; if time permits):\n",
    "- Devise an AI-based method, based on consultation with a courts reporter, for guessing which documents we should purchase from a case. This is a greater challenge because we're asking the model to encode newsworthiness directly, rather than a more well-defined category.\n",

      "Order Granting (RE: related document(s)56 Motion for Sanctions Against the Debtor under Rule 9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure filed by Creditor Nicole Glodowski). This matter is before the court on a motion to impose sanctions against debtor Richard Glodowski filed by Nicole Glodowski, which debtor resisted. (Doc. #56; Doc. #65). Trial was held on February 24, 2021. Richard Register appeared for debtor. Thomas Helget appeared for Mrs. Glodowski. The court received evidence as detailed in Doc. #100.As the prevailing party, Mrs. Glodowski is entitled to recover the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred to present the motion. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(c)(1)(A). The $17,706.50 in invoiced fees includes fees to present the motion for sanctions. However, the invoices do not include time to present testimony at the hearing on the motion for sanctions, which lasted just over two hours. Therefore, Mrs. Glodowski is awarded an additional $450.00 for the time associated with the hearing. She is also awarded $444.00 in expenses, $428.40 of which was to transcribe debtor's 341 testimony. The testimony was offered at the hearing and relied upon in this opinion.All the fees incurred and awarded are warranted for effective deterrence by others similarly situated and are reasonable. Mr. Peterson's hourly rate is commensurate with his level of experience. His work is sufficiently described and itemized. The individual time entries were a necessary part of his representation of Mrs. Glodowski.Mrs. Glodowski's motion for sanctions is GRANTED. She is awarded attorney's fees of $12,592.00 plus expenses of $444.40. Separate judgment will be entered. ORDERED by Judge Brian S. Kruse. (See pdf Written Opinion in its entirety) Search terms: Fed.

      "OPINION & ORDER as to Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad. The Government's prosecution of Mr. Sadr for alleged evasion of sanctions against Iran was marred by repeated failures to disclose exculpatory evidence and misuse of search-warrant returns. These err ors were so severe that following a jury verdict in its favor, the Government determined that further prosecution of the case would not be in the interests of justice. On the joint request of the parties, the Court vacated the jury verdict and dismis sed the charges against Mr. Sadr with prejudice....[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... IV. CONCLUSION: Although the Government's errors and ethical lapses in this case are pervasive, the Court does not find that prosecutors intentionally withh eld documents from the defense or intentionally misled the Court. The Court concludes that it has reached the limit of its appropriate involvement with the ethical issues in this case. The Office of Professional Responsibility must investigate. Beyon d that, it is the Court's hope and belief that DOJ leadership has and will take steps to ensure that these mistakes are not repeated. The Court DENIES in predominant part the applications to seal the declarations, exhibits, and letters submitted in response to the Court's September 16 Opinion.(See Citation 1 on this Opinion & Order). However, the Court will maintain the Government's supplemental letter dated October 30, 2020, and unredacted copies of the Unit Chiefs' applicat ions to seal (Dkt. Nos. 383, 387) under seal, and will allow the prosecutors' the opportunity to propose limited redactions to the full set of submitted declarations and letters. The Court thus ORDERS that within two weeks of the date of this Op inion, the prosecutors shall file their declarations and exhibits on the public docket; counsel for Mr. Sadr shall file their November 13, 2020 letter on the public docket; and the Government shall file its November 20, 2020 letter on the public dock et. Proposed redactions to this Opinion must be submitted on or before February 19, 2021. Proposed redactions to the other filings must be submitted on or before February 24, 2021. Any proposed redactions shall be consistent with the principles set f orth in Section III and shall be justified by reference to the Second Circuits decision in Lugosch, 435 F.3d 110. The Court FURTHER ORDERS that within six months of the date of this Opinion, the Government shall file a status report concerning the FB I's use of raw search-warrant returns as discussed in Section II. This Opinion shall be filed under temporary seal pending the Court's disposition of any proposed redactions submitted on or before February 19, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Dkt. No. 379. The Court sets out its reasoning in more detail in an Opinion concurrently filed under temporary seal to allow the prosecutors an opportunity to propose limited redactions. It summarizes its conclusions and orders below....[*** See this Order ***]... The Court thus ORDERS as follows: 1. The Court does not find that the prosecutors intentionally withheld documents from the defense or intentionally misled the Court, and thus will not engage in further fact-finding related t o attorney misconduct. 2. The Court urges a full investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility. 3. The Court GRANTS the motions of the press organizations to intervene and DENIES inpredominant part the prosecutors' applications to s eal. 4. The Court ORDERS the Government to submit a status report within six months concerning the FBI's use of raw search-warrant returns. The Court will permit the prosecutors to propose limited redactions to the Court's Opinion concurre ntly filed under temporary seal and their filings related to prosecutorial misconduct. Any proposed redactions shall be consistent with the principles set forth in the Court's concurrently filed Opinion and shall be justified by reference to the Second Circuit's decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Proposed redactions to the Opinion must be submitted on or before February 19, 2021. Proposed redactions to the other filings must be submitted on or before February 24, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 2/17/2021)(bw)\n",

      "ORDER denying 11 Motion to Remand to State Court. Plaintiff, taking issue with the lack of detail in the defendants declaration, insists that it would have been easy for the defendant to determine whether the claims at issue involved ERISA. T he plaintiff seeks discovery regarding the contours of the defendant's search. However, the defendant is not obligated to investigate whether a case is removable. Cutrone, 749 F.3d at 143. Furthermore, the Second Circuit has cautioned cour ts against \"expending copious time determining what a defendant should have known or have been able to ascertain at the time of the initial pleading or other relevant filing.\" Cutrone at 145. It is true that Defendant determined ERISA a pplied soon after launching a targeted search, a task not particularly labyrinthine or protracted. But, due to the lack of a clearly stated, univocal connection between the information in the EOB forms and ERISA, the defendants were required t o conduct a separate, targeted search to determine that ERISA applied. The declaration makes that clear. No discovery is warranted. Plaintiff's remaining arguments are without merit. For the reasons discussed herein, both the motion to remand and the request for discovery are denied. So Ordered.. (Signed by Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr on 2/15/2021) (js)\n",
